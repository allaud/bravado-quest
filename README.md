## Expected steps

You are suggested to clone this repo and then implement layout according to design above and a single page application based on Vue and its modules. Application should be running on a project root (`/`). The sample data to use inside application should be taken using AJAX call from the users endpoint (`/users`).

Please note, the default app state contains all profile cards. When user starts typing, the results should be filtered in realtime, highlighting the matching string.

## The task highlights

* General SPA application performance, including searching, scrolling and highlighting speed.
* HTML(JSX) and CSS quality
* JS code quality
* Search should be stateful (using browser url e.g. `/search/Boris`)
* Application should be published online for testing purposes
* Changes should be published in a fork
